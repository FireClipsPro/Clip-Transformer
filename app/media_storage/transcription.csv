0,4,But we got to talk about it a little bit down. Okay. Well there's
6,10,a laboratory right now in the Maldives that's been building prototypes using
11,15,these technological principles which are based on implosion
16,20,rather than explosion and the inspiration for Tesla ideas
24,28,are very much a part of it. Yes, test was ideas are very much a part of it. So
29,33,as I don't give her Viktor schauberger good to work with water and
34,38,discovered, look up Jamie, could
39,43,you look up Victor? I have the, I have the cable now, don't I? Take
44,48,it back to make something up
49,53,here in. I think the key thing is we're looking at technologies
54,58,that are not the same as ours. Yes. And that's probably why I just can't see them because
59,63,they're looking for us in the past and they're not open to the possibility that whole other kinds of technology
64,68,that could be used to go back to the ancient Egyptians Traditions that speak of priests
69,73,chanting. As these huge blocks with lifted into the air, where they using
74,78,some kind of sound effect, some kind of, some kind of use of sound,
79,83,it was able to manipulate matter. We know that sounds convinced. He lives matter is a matter of fact, but that lifting,
84,88,these blocks is at the gate. And again, it appears in that ancient Egyptians Traditions, the notion
89,93,that we could lift huge blocks with sound seems absurd to archaeologists. And yes, it's there and
94,98,the traditions of dija poses and what Randall's talking about now is people who are working on
99,103,a whole alternative path of technology, and maybe that's a rediscovery
104,106,of the kind of technologies that we use,
